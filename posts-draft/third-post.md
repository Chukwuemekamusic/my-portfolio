# Introduction to Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with minimal custom styling.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

- **Utility-First**: Write styles directly in your HTML.
- **Customization**: Extend and modify styles easily.
- **Performance**: Optimized for production with tree-shaking.

## Getting Started

1. Install Tailwind via npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   ```
2. Generate the configuration files:
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```
3. Add Tailwind to your CSS:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```
4. Start using Tailwind classes in your HTML:
   ```html
   <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">Click me</button>
   ```

Tailwind makes styling easy, flexible, and scalable.
