# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build server-rendered applications with ease. In this post, we'll cover the basics of setting up a Next.js project.

## Why Next.js?

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves SEO and performance.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time.
- **API Routes**: Build backend endpoints directly in your app.

## Setting Up

1. Install Next.js:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-app
   ```
2. Run the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
